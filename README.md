### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Open the client directory which hosts the front end part of the application and input your own open router api key in the file, Action.js, found in the client/src/ReduxStore folder.
3. The backend of the application is hosted on vercel and thus there is no need to configure the server directory.
4. Run the app on localhost 3000 and enjoy real time chat and chat storage on MongoDb
